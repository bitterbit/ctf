# Steps to solve
1. Compile dosbox with debug enabled

2. Examined the assembly, Saw an interesting function with loop
Running the dosbox I saw the function is not called if not given a long enough input
Also seems the input is limited to 8 bytes

3. Find the compare right after the interesting function, the wanted value is 0xcfe1
4. Input controlled strings and record the output value, this way we can know how much each letter at each position is valued
5. Solve in python
