> I heard it's raining flags somewhere, but forgot where... Thankfully there's this weather database I can use.


Running the binary prints out a prompt asking for a city to fetch weather data for.
Sadly, the flag is not "none" so I guess we should just give up and call it a day. 
```
$ ./weather
Welcome to our global weather database!
What city are you interested in?
London
Weather for today:
Precipitation: 1337mm of rain
Wind: 5km/h W
Temperature: 10Â°C
Flag: none
```

## Overview
First things first, open IDA.
The first thing we saw was not too many functions, about half of them "unreachable" from main. Additionally, there was one function referencing all of those functions, passing a reference to them to `register_prinf_function`. We called this function `configure_custon_print_functions`. 

`configure_custon_print_functions` is called on init (before main) and by putting a breakpoint at the functions it registers we can see some of them are executed in a normal execution flow.

### register_prinf_function
From the GNU manual
> 12.13.1 Registering New Conversions  
> The function to register a new output conversion is `register_printf_function`, declared in printf.h.  
> Function: _int_ **register_printf_function** _(int spec, printf_function handler-function, printf_arginfo_function arginfo-function)_

For example, to register a handler for `%Y` we would call `register_printf_function`
```c
int y_custom_handler(FILE *stream, const struct printf_info *info, const void *const *args) {
    // here we would implement our custom formatting
}
void main(){
    printf_arginfo_function args;
    register_printf_function('Y', y_custom_handler, &args);
}
```
The struct `print_info` stores metadata about the format string, for example `%52Y` would set `print_info->width = 52` and `%52.3Y` will set both width and `print_info->perc = 3`.

Disassembling `main` we can see that the last printf which is responsible for printing `Flag: none` is printed using a special printf function which is assigned the letter `%F` to my surprise the function implementation itself calls `fprintf` with the format string `%52C%s`.

As most "unreachable" functions were used while registering the custom printf functions we can assume they will be called eventually by printf, for that reason we started reversing these functions. 

Just to make sure they are all called, we made a frida script to trace the execution of these functions.

## a VM? 
Reversing the functions we discovered most of them were identical, doing the same checks at the begging and then each handler did a different operation at the end. The only handler that called `fprintf` recursively was C, more on that below 
- `M` assignment
- `S` addition
- `O` subtraction
- `X` multiply
- `V` divide
- `N` modulu
- `L` shift left
- `R` shift right
- `E` xor
- `I` and
- `U` or
- `C` conditional recursive jump

Each of the above commands takes the `printf_info` metadata and deduces from it the source and destination memory regions. There are two possible memory regions: one is just a linear memory we called "stack" and the second points to the start of the format string. 
```
.data:0000000000005080 ; char a52cS[]
.data:0000000000005080 a52cS           db '%52C%s',0
.data:0000000000005087 a31hm30le13lm14 db '%3.1hM%3.0lE%+1.3lM%1.4llS%3.1lM%3.2lO%-7.3C',0

.data:00000000000050B4                 db 'lM%2.1788llM%7C%-6144.1701736302llM%0.200hhM%0.255llI%0.37llO%020'
.data:00000000000050B4                 db '0.0C',0
```
### C - Compare Instruction
the compare instruction is implemented in the printf custom `%C` handler. This instruction has four modes: 
1) lower-than jump
2) greater-than jump
3) equal-zero jump
4) always jump. 
If the jump is taken, `fprintf` is called again (which makes it recursive) with a new format string. This format string is calculated by taking `printf_info->width` as an offset from the original format string. 

So the format string `%52C%s` is actually the opcode
```python
jump 52
# do 52 stuff...
printf(%s) # the regular %s
```
Knowing how the different opcodes are implemented we can now use a python script to convert the format string to a "toy" assembly language that will be easier to read.

## Stage 1
Disassembling the format string we can see the following assembly. We start at 0, jump to 52 where the first character of our input is loaded onto the "stack". We then jump to address 7 where we loop until a counter is zero or more.

We could think of the code at address 7 as a function that takes three arguments: character, offset to decode from and length. This function will use the first argument (our inputs first character) as a key to decrypt the data at offset 200. By chance, this is the same memory that is checked against in the last compare of block 52 and also the address where we jump in case the compare is positive. 
```python
========== 0 ==========
C.always 52
printf(%s)

# memsmoc
========== 7 ==========
(M) stack[(int) 3] = a52[stack[(int) 1]]
(E) stack[(int) 3] ^= stack[(int) 0]
(M) a52[stack[(int) 1]] = stack[(int) 3]  # decrypt fromat_string[200 + index]
(S) stack[(int) 1] += 4                   # increase 
(M) stack[(int) 3] = stack[(int) 1]
(O) stack[(int) 3] -= stack[(int) 2]      # counter -= 
(C) C.lt 7 stack[(int) 3] < 0             # while counter < 0

========== 52 ==========
stack[(int) 0] = a52[4096]       # user input
stack[(int) 0] &= 255            # first letter of user input

stack[(int) 1] = stack[(int) 0]  # copy the first letter
stack[(int) 1] <<= 8
stack[(int) 0] |= stack[(int) 1]

stack[(int) 1] = stack[(int) 0]
stack[(int) 1] <<= 16
stack[(int) 0] |= stack[(int) 1]  # c

stack[(int) 1] = 200           # func_7(c, 200, 1788)
stack[(int) 2] = 1788
C.always 7

at52[6144] = 1701736302         # "none"
stack[(int) 0] = a52[200]       # get first char from format_string[200]
stack[(int) 0] &= 255
stack[(int) 0] -= 37            # fromat_string[200] == '%'
C.eq 200 stack[(int) 0] == 0    # check if decrypted stage two successfully
```

As it takes into account only the first character we could just try all ascii characters until one of the proves to be the correct answer (one where the jump of the last compare is taken). After trying some inputs we found that 'T' was a valid input ðŸŽŠ 

## Stage 2
Executing the VM with the input of 'T' the conditional jump is taken and the new code at 200 is executed flawlessly. We can now dump it out to human readable assembly

_the main code for stage 2_
```python
========== 200 ==========
stack[(int) 4] = 5000
stack[(int) 0] = 13200
C.always 337                  # this loops 400~ times

stack[(int) 0] = 0
C.always 500                  # loop over input and mangle it

C.always 1262                 # validate mangled input using xor

C.eq 653 stack[(int) 0] == 0  # check if output of 1262 is zero
                              # if so, 653 decrypts winning print command (using original input as key)
```

Writing the same code in c would result in
```c
int func_200() {
    func_337(5000, 13200);

    mangle_input();               // func_500;
    if (validate_input() == 0) {  // func_1262
        // print_flag is a calculation over input so one 
        // cannot just execute print_flag without the correct input
        print_flag();             // func_653
    }
}
```

### Mangling Input
Nothing smart here, just go line by line and reverse the assembly to python. 
It took me time to realize this function works because its recursive. Basically, it decreases some input number by different rules, counting how much iterations it takes until this number turns to zero, returning the number of iterations. 

_Our result "decompiled code" looks something like this_
```py
# 500:
def mangle_loop(input_s):
    output = [0 for x in range(len(input_s))]

    for i in range(len(input_s)):
        c = input_s[i]
        c = ord(c) ^ (stage_two_main[i * 2] & 0xff)
        c += do_470(i + 1) + 1
        c = c & 0xff
        output[i] = c

    return output


def do_470(var_0):
    var_1 = var_0 - 1
    var_1 -= 1

    if var_1 == 0: # 397
        return 0

    if var_1 < 0:
        return var_0 - 2

    # var_1 > 0 :428
    var_1 = var_0 % 2

    if var_1 == 0: # :405
        var_0 = var_0 // 2
    if var_1 > 0:
        var_0 *= 3
        var_0 += 1

    var_0 = do_470(var_0)
    return var_0 + 1
```

### Reversing the Input Validation
We know how to transform our input exactly in the same way function 500 does. We know that the result of 1262 is stored in `stack[0]` and that this the condition of the last conditional jump. Any input we had manually tried did not match the condition, all of this made me think that if 1262 would return 0, our jump to 653 would print out the flag.

Summing up, 1262 is a validation function that takes as an input the mangled bytes from our input string, and returns the result on `stack[0]` where 0 means the validation was successful. 

_The begginning of code at 1262_
```py
========== 1262 ==========
stack[(int) 0] = 0                     # result = 0

stack[(int) 1] = 0
stack[(int) 1] += 4500                 # mangled user input offset
stack[(int) 1] = a52[stack[(int) 1]]   # var1 = mangled[0]
stack[(int) 2] = 0
stack[(int) 2] += 1374542625
stack[(int) 2] += 1686915720
stack[(int) 2] += 1129686860           # var2 = (int) (1374542625 + 1686915720 + 1129686860)
stack[(int) 1] ^= stack[(int) 2]       
stack[(int) 0] |= stack[(int) 1]       # result |= var1 ^ var2
```

This code snippet is repeated for every 4 characters from 0 to 24, each time with a different value in var2. We know the first letter is 'T' so breaking the first 4 letters should be possible using simple brute force on the remaining 3 letters and doing so give us the first 4 letters: "TheN". 

Continuing from here we should have used z3 to create constraints and solve this efficiently but we were lazy so we just continued brute forcing 4 letters a time. This took around 3 hours using 1 cpu core in python. 

The brute forcing code is simple: try any combination of 4 ascii letters, send them to `mangle_function` and then xor the result with the appropriate value (from 1262). A valid result is one where `mangle(input[i:i+4])) ^ magic == 0`

_pseudo brute force code_
```py
import itertools

def brute():
    start = '0'
    end = 'z'
    magic = ctypes.c_int(1374542625 + 1686915720 + 1129686860).value
    
    for i in itertools.product(range(ord(start), ord(end) + 1), repeat=4):
        s = ''.join([chr(x) for x in i])
        out_mem = mangle_input(s)
        result = arr_to_int(out_mem)
        
        if result ^ magic == 0:
            print('found input!', s)
```
